Very interesting article (posted by Ibe yesterday I think) about the colors for better visualization.

These are the colors I'm using in Python:
['#ffc078','#ffe066','#cdeb75','#8ce99a','#63e6be','#66d9e8','#74c0fc','#91a7ff','#b197fc','#e599f7','#faa2c1','#ffaba8','#dee2e6']
[orange,yellow,lime,green,teal,cyan,blue,indigo,violet,grape,pink,red,gray]
